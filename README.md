# BlackJack Royale

## What will the project do?

The Blackjack Royale project will be an application that simulates a game of Blackjack. It will provide an 
interactive interface for users to play the game against a computer-controlled dealer. The application will adhere to 
the standard rules of Blackjack, including card values, player options (hit, stand etc.), and win/lose 
conditions.

## Who will use it?

The Blackjack Royale project is designed for individuals who enjoy playing Blackjack and allow them play the game in a 
digital format.

## Why is this project of interest to you?

This project would be of interest to me because:

- **Interest in Creating Games**: I find the process of game development to be incredibly engaging. It allows me to 
combine creativity with technical skills, resulting in an interactive and enjoyable experience for users.

- **Looks Simple but Can be Expanded to be Quite Complex**: On the surface, a Blackjack game might seem straightforward, 
but it offers a pathway for a complex design. From implementing advanced game logic to adding features like betting or 
multiple player modes, there's ample room for growth and refinement.
